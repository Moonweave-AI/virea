# Troubleshooting

> [English](troubleshooting.en.md) · [中文](troubleshooting.zh-CN.md)

Diagnose the layer that failed; do not disable validation or edit result files to force a successful-looking state.

| Symptom | First check | Safe next action |
|---|---|---|
| `RUNTIME_NOT_BUILDABLE` before installation | `doctor` domain report and model profiles | Free resources or select a profile the Worker actually implements in the chosen domain. |
| Asset acquisition fails | Revision, license acknowledgement, network and disk | Review the plan and run `model repair`; failed acquisition must not become READY. |
| Runtime build fails | Target-domain Python/uv/lock and captured tail | Repair the selected domain; do not install dependencies manually into the checkout. |
| Worker readiness times out | Startup limit, offline assets and model load logs | Verify, then repair; ensure the process tree has stopped. |
| Generation times out/cancels | Job state, Worker instance and child tree | Let bounded cancellation finish; never publish a partial result. |
| VRMA validation fails | Rest hips, root translation, track counts and finite values | Fix exporter/adapter rather than hiding it in Viewer code. |
| Avatar disappears/crops | VRM rest pose, VRMA absolute hips and console | Re-run Viewer QA against the real artifact. |

```bash
# Produce a local diagnostic summary from the persistent home configured once after cloning.
uv run virea support

# Inspect local state without changing it.
uv run virea state inspect

# Verify the newest flood-diffusion-tiny READY installation without changing it; replace its model ID only if diagnosing another manifest.
uv run virea model verify flood-diffusion-tiny
```

When reporting an issue, provide model/result identity, execution domain, doctor report ID, installation/job/result IDs and
the smallest relevant log tail. Do not upload checkpoints, private Avatars, raw datasets or the complete state database.
For the one-time root setup and copied-path quotation rules, see [the data-root guide](../getting-started/persistent-data-root.en.md).
